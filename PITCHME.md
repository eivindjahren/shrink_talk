# Help, I need to download 1gb of data to reproduce the bug!
---

Let's go back to 2014...

+++

* Russian forces are on the crimean peninsula
* The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has just begun
* And I am in the midst of figuring out a big bug in my phd thesis.

+++

* My SAT solver is producing the wrong result.
* Can compare result with someone elses SAT solver.
* 10mb input file
* Takes about 2 minutes and 100,000s of inference steps.

+++

I try several approaches

valgrind

---

conditional breaks in debugger

---

staring contest with the code


---

Finally: finding a smaller input file

---

The data: $ x1 \lor x2 \lor x3 \lor x4 \ldots $

---

Really just sets of sets of numbers

---

Use "shrinking": steepest gradiant descent search


+++

Shrinking was developed for Property Testing

---

QuickCheck: a haskell property testing library

---

Hypothesis: a python property testing library

---

With Hypothesis and QuickCheck, no need to write the shrinking algorithm...

---

... But we will do that anyways
